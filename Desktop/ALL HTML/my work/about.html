                The prevalence of sexual immorality among students at various levels of education in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. It has grown to a level that creates fear and tension in the heart of anyone who has concern for the future of Nigeria as a nationand that of the teeming youth that populates Nigeria. The society is grappling with many behavioral problems of the students which according to Ekundayo and Oyeniyi [2008] and Adebule[2012] include truancy, disobedience, drug offences, smoking, flirting, stealing and armed robbery, violent conduct and demonstration, vandalism, examination malpractices, cultism and thuggery. In addition to the above listed widely publicized behavioral problems, Dotonu [20 11] stated that heterosexual and homosexual activities are also viewed as part of the behavioralproblems prevalent in Nigeria schools. They are coined in the literature as sex abuse, sex offences, sexual misconduct, immorality, promiscuity and maladjustment (Omoteso, Adeniyiand Bala, 2010 and Anise, 2011). However, Dotonu (2011)observed that sex abuse appeared to be one of the most serious offences committed by children and adolescents. 

One of the outstanding remarkable virtues of a good societyshould be sexual purity which has received little or no attention from the society today. Also, sexual immorality has eaten deep into the fabric of the society. It has become the mainstay of the youth behavior (Adebule, 2012). The young ones who ought to be
deeply devoted to their studies have taken sexuality to be their major daily dealings. Majority of the students/pupils are major in sexual immorality but minor in academics (Dotonu, 2011).
Researches have shown (Omoteso, Adeniyi and Bada, 2010, Anise, 2011 and Adebiyi, 2001) that sexual immorality has thousands of destructive effects on students/pupils. Such includes unforeseen an unwanted pregnancies (Ale, 2006) and infection through sexually transmitted diseases. Across the globe, people now embrace modern principles of living thereby compromising the sexual purity without having a rethink, according to Ajayi (2006) and Adebule (2012), the incidence of sexual immorality among Nigeria youth has become sporadic.
This has been attributed to the negative influence of mass- media especially the pornographic films and video freely displayed, circulated and watched on a daily basis.
Dotonu. (2011) found out that many boys and girls are often found with contraceptive in schools and colleges today and that the wave of sexuality that is engulfing the youth is accompanied by increase in thefts, covetousness, jealousy, pride, shamelessness, selfishness, wickedness, rebellion and violence. In addition to this, a case of two primary school pupils (male and female) in Field Base Nursery and Primary School in (AMAC) were found with contraceptive (condom) in June, 2013.
Studies show that most adolescents spend the greatestPart of their time watching video and movies (Adesoola andUtibe,2001; Buerkel, 2005). They also spend quite long time in browsing, downloading, chatting and watching movies on
internet As noted by Folagbade (2003) , with mass production of visual images, videos, television etc. now found in places, which were formerly not reached by these media, the world has eventually become a global villages exposing the youth to various explicit cantered. The rate at which Nigerian movies and videos are produced is so alarming that the market is flooded with all sorts of movies.
As noted by Filani (2001) Nigerian movies has been found to greatly influence the attributes, moral, values and behaviors of these adolescents. Odesola, (2001) contended that despite the effects of moderating agencies, many Nigerian producers are still flooding the market with all forms of exotic pictures. Most of Nollywood movies and videos characters serve as a role model to the adolescents. On many new stands we now find magazines, pictures, posters etc on sexually arousing materials. As a result, the youths are exposed to sexual material before they are mentally ready for them. The laws guiding the purchase and viewing of movies are not binding, as anybody can obtain any kind of movie from video houses (Ivowi, 1999;Fafunwa, 2003, Unachukwu, 2003 and Adegoke, 2003). The impact of Nollywood movie on the sexual attitude and activities of these adolescents are enormous. As observed by OwLlamanam (2005), movies and pictures are forms of instructional materials through which the young ones acquire new attitude. This is compounded by the illegal production of soft-core and hard-core movies. There appears to be a consensus among Nigerian researchers and observers that many traditional values arechanging rapidly and replaced by media project values. One area of life which the decline of traditional values is obvious is in the area of sexuality. One major change has been the acceptance If premarital sex in a loving relationship. Researchers lament that in Nigeria, cultures no longer have grip on the youths as our society seems to be cloaked with decade moral codes and values. They confirmed that the sense of right and wrong have been eroded which is due to changing society through which various means of communication has made adolescents to be more sexually active. 
This is because the youths have been formed to be thrilled by sexual discourse and information. This seems to affect the youth, adolescents more than any other group as this is manifested in the acceptance of sex before marriage, homosexual behavior, lesbianism, abortion, etc. (Adebule 2012).
